xd.bot

xd.bot is a simple discord bot which is used to be an exercise project where I started my coding journey. It was my first touch with technical documentation (discord.js), npm's, API's, Node.js and JavaScript itself.
This version is no longer developed. It's just a showcase demo.

Bot has features like:

- integration with chat GPT API (da-vinci v3),
- integration with DALL-E 2 (AI generated images),
- simple text commands (like dice etc.)
- YT video streaming on voice channels (by links and keywords) using DisTube,
- soundboards,
- image grabber from given subreddits (using RedditFetch npm).

Known issues:

- using banned words for GPT / DALL-E inputs can cause crashes,
- multiple requests of soundboards / YT streaming cause huge delays or crashes,
- OpenAI API is under trial license, so some features can be no longer available.
